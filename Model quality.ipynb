Данные для обучения моделей необходимо загрузить самостоятельно с [сайта](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). Целевая переменная – наличие болезни сердца (HeartDisease). Она принимает значения 0 или 1 в зависимости от отсутствия или наличия болезни соответственно. Подробное описание признаков можно прочесть в описании датасета на сайте. Для выполнения работы не обязательно вникать в медицинские показатели.\n","\n","**Этапы работы:**\n","\n","1. Получите данные и загрузите их в рабочую среду. (Jupyter Notebook или другую)\n","\n","2. Подготовьте датасет к обучению моделей:\n","\n","  a) Категориальные переменные переведите в цифровые значения. Можно использовать pd.get_dummies, preprocessing.LabelEncoder. Старайтесь не использовать для этой задачи циклы.\n","\n","3. Разделите выборку на обучающее и тестовое подмножество. 80% данных оставить на обучающее множество, 20% на тестовое.\n","\n","4. Обучите модель логистической регрессии с параметрами по умолчанию.\n","\n","5. Подсчитайте основные метрики модели. Используйте следующие метрики и функцию:\n","\n","cross_validate(…, cv=10, scoring=['accuracy','recall','precision','f1'])\n","\n","6. Оптимизируйте 3-4 параметра модели:\n","\n","  a) Используйте GridSearchCV.\n","\n","  b) Используйте RandomizedSearchCV.\n","\n","  c) *Добавьте в п. 6b 2-5 моделей классификации и вариации их параметров.\n","\n","  d) Повторите п. 5 после каждого итогового изменения параметров.\n","\n","7. Сформулируйте выводы по проделанной работе:\n","\n","  a) Сравните метрики построенных моделей.\n","\n","  b) *Сравните с полученными результатами в задании по теме «Ансамблирование».\n","\n","Результат:\n","\n","Получены знания по оптимизации параметров."],"metadata":{"id":"VDXPGjBqOIrm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1.
